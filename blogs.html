        <h2>Inner Goblins : My Learnings</h2>
        <p>
          Date : 21 June 2024 <br>
          Sometimes we are just in the search of making ourselves the best. Atleast I always try to compensate my past regrets with present acheivements. But sometimes I think that, Is there a end towards working on healing myself? 
          Till know, I had never reached to a conclusion. I think none exists. But my inner self will always to try to make a search for it. I think those regrets can not be healed even if you achieve everything.
          Sometimes, I feel that these inner goblins are helping me in growing. But my purpose of the end is not clear. Neither I want to leave the aspiration to be at the top nor I know what is the top is. <br>
          Who should win ? The aspiration to top or my inner peace? Analysing in a utilitarian way, I found myself in a condition where I was collaborating with these inner goblins and was growing in a random direction.
          Today, I realised that there exists no healing for past regrets. We just make ourselves busy in other things to forget about the pain. I realized that no acheivement could help in healing those regrets. 
          For a while I thought to fight for top but I found there is not top. It'a just not finite at all. <br>
          This is like losing a number k but you are running till infinity to find this number k. Nothing can fill up the value of k. So just stopped running at all. Instead I choose to have fun. Fun is relative. And meta
